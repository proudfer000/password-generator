# Random Password Generator

This password generator will generate a **random** one depending on user input, it can be from 8 to 128 characters long and can include **Uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters.**

For this app to work the user needs to **input a number between 8 tp 128**, by default it will be 8 but if the user leave the field empty the app will send an **alert** message saying that it needs to input a number, the length field only allows for number.

Also the user needs to check **at least one box**, if it fail to do so, the user will get prompted to so.

And finally, the user can choose the use the '''copy btn''' if they decide so, also the user cant modify the generated password because the field its **readonly**.
